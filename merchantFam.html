            for the same orthopedic surgeons the last 23 years as thier PA. Jordyn had a hard time deciding
            at first on what she wanted to do but is now on her third year working full time as a medical
            coder at the hospital and going to the local college as a full time student for computer
            programming and cybersecurity. Corbin graduated from MSU Bozeman last winter and has now started his
            first year of medical school through the WAMI Program in Bozeman where he hopes to become a surgeon
