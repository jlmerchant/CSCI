        <p>The Larson side of my family has some very interesting facts I've found so far. The Nelson

            be in their 90s.</p>

        <p>Peder Jeppsen was born in Denmark where he met and married his wife Charlotte Nielsdotter
            Jeppsen. The couple had a large family of 15 children, unfortunately not all children had a long
            life. It's also possible he had 2 children from a different relationship. Peder and Charlotte
            traveled to the U.S. with the family in 1901 arriving in New York. From there they moved to Utah
            where 2 of their sons became a blacksmith and an electrician according to the 1910 Census.</p>

        <h2>&#152;Earl and Martha Larson&#152;</h2>
        <p>Earl Larson was born to Theodore and Allena Larson in Havre 1917. At the age of 22 he married
            Martha Lena Kostecka, daughter of Josef Kostecka Jr. and Antonie "Nettie" Prokes of Czechoslovakia.
            Earl and Martha worked hard and through their life were able to grow their farm tremendously and
            eventually started ranching as well. They taught their three kids, Mavis Marie and Robert, the tricks
            of farming and ranching to eventually hand the farm down to their youngest, Robert, and his family.
            In their older years, Martha had a stroke which put her in a nursing home. Earl would visit her every
            day, nothing would stop him, from 12:30 to 5:00, Earl would always say she might come out of and would
            be able to come home.</p>

        <h2>&#152;Martha and Joseph Kostecka&#152;</h2>
        <p>Martha was born to Josef Kostecka Jr. and Antonie "Nettie" Prokes in Czechoslovakia. Both Josef
            and Antonie were born in Czechoslovakia until they came to the United States. As an adult Josef was
            in the carpentry business until arriving in the United States in 1908. Netting planned to leave for
            America to be with Joseph on April 10, 1912 on The Titanic but luck was in her favor that day.
            Nettie forgot a suitcase as the ship was boarding, she went back to grab her suitcase and didn't
            make it back in time to board the ship. She ended up arriving in the United States August 1912.
            Nettie and Josef married in Minnesota in 1914 where they had their first two children Marcella and
            Stanley. It was once the family moved to Havre to start their farm is when the family had their
            third child, Martha. This couple is one where I had been told Josef died years before Nettie but
            I found paperwork showing Nettie and Josef divorced in 1950 for "mental cruelty" and Josef died in
            California in 1968 while Nettie stayed in Havre until her death in 1988.</p>
